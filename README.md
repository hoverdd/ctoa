# ctoa

ctoa - char to ascii conversion CLI tool (decimal, hex, binary).

---

## Overview
ctoa is a simple CLI tool that prints each character of the input string alongside its ASCII value in decimal, hexadecimal, and binary. Itâ€™s designed to show how character encodings work under the hood, focusing on ASCII rather than Unicode.

---

## Why?
This is an educational project. I had a computer science class on Information Encoding, and I got really interested in it. I wanted to automate conversion from decimal to binary, hex, etc.

--

## Features
- ASCII output in decimal
- Conversion to hex, binary

---

## Build
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hoverdd/ctoa.git
cd ctoa
make
```

## Usage
To pass multiple words add quotes (`"hello world"`).
```bash
./ctoa "text" # quotes are useful when you type a lot of text not just a word
``` 

Example:
```bash
./ctoa "i love cats"
   Dec | Hex |  Bin
--------------------
i: 105   69     1101001
 : 32    20     100000
l: 108   6C     1101100
o: 111   6F     1101111
v: 118   76     1110110
e: 101   65     1100101
 : 32    20     100000
c: 99    63     1100011
a: 97    61     1100001
t: 116   74     1110100
s: 115   73     1110011
```

## Future improvements
- Read from a file and stdin, also from pipes
- Colorful output for readabilty
